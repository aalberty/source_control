# home rolled source control

## next time
- play with ways to display the diff
    - inline
    - side-by-side
    - give the two documents color pickers to determine the diff highlights
- checkpointing or versioning
    - more refined auto-save feature
- 'layered' version display
    - scroll to shuffle through different versions of a document
    - change the "axis" that you're scrolling on to scroll based on different filters
        - authors' branches
        - timeline versions
- play with the idea of an "exploded" view (stacked pieces of a whole; iron man suit)
    - blocks, scope, open/close delimiters, etc can all be ways to divvy up contents of
      files for this view

## last time
- super-lite editor for testing purposes
- basic comparison and diff-display
